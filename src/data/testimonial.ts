        quote: 'I reached out to Komal Ma’am in February last year after a breakup that completely affected my confidence, focus, and work performance. While preparing for my CAT exam and coming from an orthodox family, I felt emotionally overwhelmed and stuck. Through her gentle guidance, I slowly began healing. She encouraged me to explore my interest in singing, guided me through closure therapy, and helped me manage my anger and frustrations. Over time, my confidence returned. Today, I am pursuing my MBA from a reputed institution and have performed on stage in singing and hosting events. I still reach out to Komal Ma’am whenever I feel confused, and she helps me find clarity through meaningful conversations. I am deeply grateful for her support in helping me rebuild myself.',

        quote: 'At 11 years old, I was going through a very difficult phase in my life and struggled with anxiety, studies, and bed-wetting. Speaking to Komal Ma’am every week made me feel safe, heard, and understood. I could talk to her openly, just like I would with my mother. She helped me understand my feelings and taught me how to handle my worries in a calm way. I slowly started believing in myself again and felt more secure emotionally. With her support, I have become more confident, my grades have improved, and my bed-wetting has completely stopped. I feel calmer and stronger now. I am truly grateful to Komal Ma’am for guiding me with so much care and helping me grow into a happier and more confident person.'

        quote: 'I reached out to Komal Ma’am in July 2025 during one of the lowest phases of my life. After my legal venture failed, I lost confidence and had been on medication for three years without much relief. Komal Ma’am encouraged me to take small steps both professionally and personally, while guiding me towards yoga, meditation, and gratitude practices. With time, my sessions reduced, my medicines were tapered, and my confidence returned. In November, I received a very good job opportunity in Delhi NCR. Today, I feel calmer, stronger, and truly grateful to Komal Ma’am for trusting me, validating me, and helping me believe in myself again.',

        quote: 'I approached Komal Ma’am feeling frustrated and close to quitting football, as I was unable to communicate my goals to my parents, who were against my playing the sport. In just three sessions, she helped me understand the importance of communication and gave me a safe, non-judgmental space to express my frustrations. With renewed confidence, I spoke openly to my parents, who eventually supported my decision. Today, I leave home at 5 a.m. to coach at a school, play football, and manage my studies. I am deeply grateful to Komal Ma’am for helping me find clarity, confidence, and my voice.',
